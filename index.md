## 📖 About

uploadProject is a side project created with PHP. This application aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for uploading files. Whether you're managing documents or sharing images, uploadProject is designed to help you do it efficiently.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with uploadProject, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Application**  
   Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/teamkura1/uploadProject/releases) to obtain the latest version of the software. 

2. **Install the Software**  
   Download the software from the Releases page. You will find a ZIP file that contains all necessary files. Unzip the downloaded file into a folder of your choice. This will set up the application on your local machine.

3. **Set Up Your Environment**  
   This application requires a local server that supports PHP and MySQL. You can use software like XAMPP or MAMP to set up a local server quickly. Install one of these servers and start it.

   After unzipping the downloaded files, move them to the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP or MAMP installation. This allows the application to run on your local server.

5. **Create a Database**  
   Using a tool like phpMyAdmin (which comes with XAMPP or MAMP), create a new database for uploadProject. You may name it `upload_project_db`.

6. **Edit Configuration File**  
   Open the configuration file located in the folder you unzipped. Enter your database connection details, which include the database name, username, and password.

7. **Run the Application**  
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/uploadProject`. You should see the uploadProject homepage. You are now ready to start using the application!
